Sparse unordered integer sets

Copyright 2013 Geoff Gole

Synopsis

A simple C99 library that implements set operations on integers. The
goal is to improve performance and memory use compared to a red-black
tree while still guaranteeing reasonable worst-case bounds (unlike,
say, a hash table).

Building

Copy the source files into your tree and include them in whatever
your build process is. With two files and zero dependencies, there's
no point in a Makefile.

The source should compile cleanly under any C99 compiler, or a C89
compiler with support for stdint.h and the inline keyword. It does not
compile as C++.
